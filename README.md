# CipherMaster

Welcome to `CipherMaster` - a comprehensive repository dedicated to exploring and implementing classic cryptographic methods. This project starts with an iconic piece of cryptographic history: the Caesar Cipher.

## About the Project

`CipherMaster` aims to bring historical cryptography to life by providing clear, concise, and well-documented code examples. Starting with the Caesar Cipher, this repository will gradually expand to include various other classic cryptographic techniques.

### What's Inside?

- **Caesar Cipher Implementation**: A simple yet effective demonstration of the Caesar Cipher algorithm in C. This includes both encryption and decryption functionalities.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each cryptographic method is accompanied by detailed comments explaining the logic and historical context.
- **Interactive Menu**: A user-friendly console interface for easy interaction with the cipher functionalities.
